# Introduction

This is a collection of code explicitly calculating the stationary distribution of the recombination Markov chain. 

# Files 
## StationaryDistribution.py
This code finds the stationary distribution for any size graph divided into any number of equal districticts. 
### Requirements
In order to memoize our code we use:
https://pypi.org/project/memoization/
```bash
pip install memoization
```

## AnalysisFunctions.py
This code is a compilation of functions we found useful in anaylyzing the stationary disibution. 

## Graphs.py
This is a partial collection of initialized NetworkX graphs we analyzed.
